    <p class="fax">Romans 8:38-39
        For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
        <br>
        <br>
        Lamentations 3:22-23
        The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
        <br>
        <br>
        2 Corinthians 4:16-18
        So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen.
        <br>
        <br>
        John 15:13
        Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ephesians 3:20
        Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us.
        <br>
        <br>
        Deuteronomy 31:6
        Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, or the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.
        <br>
        <br>
        Psalm 27:12
        The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
        <br>
        <br>
        John 4:18
        There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
